## INTRODUCTION
Business intelligence is an all-encompassing term that includes tools, infrastructure and applications that help in analyzing, evaluating and visualizing data. With help of BI software, one can envision relationships within the data that help organizations make knowledgeable business decisions. Using business intelligence tools, organizations can integrate their data and create reports, dashboards, metrics and scorecards to gain insights. 
Business intelligence suites by definition need to incorporate techniques like data processing, data modelling, querying, visualizing among other things. IBMs Cognos Business Intelligence is one among the many suites that has an extensive set of options ranging from exploration, modelling and querying to data visualization. The Cognos BI suite has multiple components including report studio, event studio, metric studio, framework manager, workspace among many others. 

## HISTORY
Cognos was a consulting and performance management company that was founded in 1969. It was acquired by IBM into its Infosphere product line in 2008 when companies like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft were fighting to become leaders in the BI market. In 2005, the company had released its Cognos 8 suite which introduced tools such as the Report studio, Query studio, Analysis studio and many others. After the acquisition by IBM, IBM Cognos 10 was released that had the capability to incorporate SPSS predictive analytics, historical and real-time analysis, better, faster and more flexible way of generating reports and dashboards. The next version of Cognos was the IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2.2 that had the ability to integrate Microsoft Office with Cognos.
The latest edition of Cognos is the IBM Cognos Analytics 11.0 which is a state-of-the-art Analytics tool. This version of Cognos is a very powerful BI tool with ability to connect to Hadoop, an in-built AI assistant and smart data-discovery
